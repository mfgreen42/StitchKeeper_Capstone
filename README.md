This app is called StitchKeeper. I made it to keep track of patterns and photos of embroidery and cross stitch projects that I've completed. 

I used Django Rest Framewor, mySQL database, Postman, React, React-Google-charts and CSS

In the future I would like to add the ability to search by patter or artist name when adding a photo. I would like to change the graph on the Dashboard page to a calendar heatmap like the one used in GitHub. I love that they look like cross stitch and I think it would fit in nicely.
